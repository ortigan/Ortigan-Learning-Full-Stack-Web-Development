# Prerequisite and Installation

## Prerequisite

Before you continue you should have a basic understanding of the following:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Setting up the Environment

### PHP is a server side scripting language; hence it requires server to execute script.

Some common web server's are:

1. Apache Http Server
2. NGINX
3. Apache Tomcat
4. Node.js
5. Lighttpd

We are going to use Apache Http Server in this course, because it is easy to use and it easy to setup  as it is support cross platform 

> Apache powers 52% of all websites globally

Instead of downloading it separately what we can do is download WAMP, XAMPP, MAPP, AMPPS, MAMP or any other software to download that comes with Apache Http Server 

We will be using WAMP (Windows Apache MySQL PHP)

for download go to link [https://www.wampserver.com](https://www.wampserver.com/) 

### To store information or data, PHP also needs some database management system

Some widely used database management systems:

1. MySQL
2. PostGreSQL
3. SYBASE
4. IBM-DB2
5. Oracle Database

We are going to use MySQL in this course, because it is secure and reliable database management system.  Also we can start working on MySQL very quickly, as it takes a few minutes for the download and to install, regardless of the platform. MySQL can be implemented on many platforms such as Linux, MAC, Windows. MySQL is scalable and can handle a huge amount of data.

Download it separately because it have many feature such as Workbench, command line interface and many more.
